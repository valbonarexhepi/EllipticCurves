Extension of .NET classes for supporting the Elliptical Curves

The project includes implementation of code in c# for .NET classes expansion to support elliptic curves. The project includes 3 main functionalities: generate key pair (public/private) keys over the specified curve, encryption and decryption via hybrid algorithm ECDH combined with AES.
